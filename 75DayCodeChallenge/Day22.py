# Que. Here is a weird problem in Susanâ€™s terminal. He can not write more than two words each line,
# if she writes more than two, it takes only 2 words and the rest are not taken. 
# So she needs to use enter and put the rest in a new line. 
# For a given paragraph, how many lines are needed to be written in Susanâ€™s terminal?
